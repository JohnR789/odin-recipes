# odin-recipes
Welcome to Odin Recipes, a simple recipe website project built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. This project is designed to help me practice and reinforce my HTML skills.

Project Goals
    The main objectives of this project are:

    Practice HTML: Create a multi-page website using basic HTML elements.

    Build a Recipe Website: The website includes a main index page that links to individual recipe pages.

    Organize Content: Each recipe page includes a title, image, description, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.

    Learn Git and GitHub: Set up and manage a GitHub repository, commit changes frequently, and publish the project online.

Features
    Index Page: The landing page with links to all recipes.

    Recipe Pages: Individual pages for each recipe containing:

        A title and image of the dish.
        A brief description of the recipe.
        A list of ingredients needed.
        Step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish.
        Responsive Links: All links are structured within an unordered list for better readability.

Technologies Used
    HTML5: Structuring the content of the website.
    Git & GitHub: Version control and project hosting.
    Future Enhancements
    CSS Styling: Add styles to improve the visual appeal of the website.
